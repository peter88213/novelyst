# Arcs

## What are arcs?

*novelyst* provides *arcs* as a powerful and flexible concept for plotting.
The term *plot* refers to the consequent course of the narrative action. 
"Arc" can mean a variety of things: Narrative strand, thread, character arc, storyline, sequence of cause and effect, sequence of setup and payoff, road map with milestones, and so on. You can think of an arc as a line on which points are arranged that characterize the progression of the story. These points can be assigned to scenes to indicate the scene's relevance to the plot. 

- *novelyst* lets you define any number of arcs. 
- Any number of scenes can be assigned to each arc. 
- Any number of arcs can be assigned to each scene.
- Each arc can contain any number of points. 
- Each point can be assigned to exactly one scene. 

The association of scenes and arc points is shown in the "Plot" column of the tree view.

## What about acts?

If you want to divide a story into phases according to a dramaturgical scheme, for example into acts or steps, arcs are not necessarily the means of choice. This is because their points have to be assigned to specific scenes.
Better suited for this are "todo" type chapters, which are inserted between the regular chapters at the beginning of each phase. This gives you color-coded subheadings in the tree view, and also gives you the option of documenting your dramaturgical model in as much detail as you like, e.g. with "todo" scenes underneath.

This method can of course be combined well with arc points, which in this case can be created as plot points such as pinch point, turning point, climax, etc.

## How to define arcs

*novelyst* implements arcs as "Todo" type chapters with an **Arc name** entry. 

## How to groupg arcs

"Arc" chapters can be placed anywhere in the story. However, It is recommended to put them into "Todo" type parts, so they appear in *novelyst's* "Planning" subtree. You can either create one part, called e.g. "Narrative arcs", or create any number of parts, e.g. one for character arcs, and one for setup/payoff sequences, and so on.

## How to rename arcs


## How to create arc points

*novelyst* implements arcs as scenes in "arc" chapters. If you add a scene to an arc defining "Todo" chapter, This scene is automatically assigned to the chapter's arc.
