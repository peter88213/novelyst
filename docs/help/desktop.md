# Desktop overview


The *novelyst* desktop is divided into three panes:

![Desktop](../Screenshots/desktop01.png)


- The **project tree** in the left pane shows the organization of the project. The **Book** branch contains the parts, chapters, and scenes that belong to the novel manuscript. The **Characters/Locations/Items** branches contain descriptions of the story world's elements that can be associated with the book's scenes. The **Research** branch contains all *Notes* type parts with chapters and scenes intended for the documentation of the story world. The **Planning** branch contains all *Todo* type parts with chapters and scenes intended to build the dramaturgical structure of the story. This is the right place for planning plot points, archetypes, character arcs, and so on. 
- The **Content viewer** in the middle pane shows the part/chapter/scene contents with their titles as headings. The content viewer scrolls automatically to the element selected in the tree view.
- The **Properties** in the right pane show properties/metadata of the element selected in the project tree.
